title: Commentary - Tough-on-crime policies in wildlife conservation
---

definitions

wildlife crime reduction usually involves species legal protection, enforcement of existing protections, punitive sentencing policies


areas with weak political institution will have a problem with such interventions (militarized anti-poaching strategies, punitive sentencing)

sentencing in this paper != punishment, it relies on judicial processes
